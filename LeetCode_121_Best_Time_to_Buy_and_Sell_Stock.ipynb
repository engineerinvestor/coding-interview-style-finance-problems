        "This solution is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit you can achieve from a list of stock prices, where you can only buy and sell once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "    - `min_price` is initialized to the first element in the `prices` list. This variable keeps track of the minimum price encountered so far, which represents the best day to buy the stock up to the current day in the loop.\n",
        "    - `max_profit` is initialized to 0. This variable stores the maximum profit found so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loop through prices**:\n",
        "    - The for loop iterates through the prices list starting from the second element (`prices[1:]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculate potential profit**:\n",
        "    - In each iteration, it calculates the potential profit for selling on the current day (`price`) and buying on the day when the `min_price` was recorded (`price - min_price`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Update max profit**:\n",
        "    - It updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of the current `max_profit` and the newly calculated potential profit.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Update minimum price**:\n",
        "    - It updates `min_price` to be the minimum of the current `min_price` and the current `price`, ensuring that `min_price` always holds the lowest price encountered so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Return result**:\n",
        "    - After completing the loop, it returns `max_profit`, which now contains the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling once.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Iterate through the list:\n",
        "  - `price = 1`:\n",
        "    - Update `max_profit`: `max(0, 1 - 7) = 0`\n",
        "    - Update `min_price`: `min(7, 1) = 1`\n",
        "  - `price = 5`:\n",
        "    - Update `max_profit`: `max(0, 5 - 1) = 4`\n",
        "    - `min_price` remains 1.\n",
        "  - `price = 3`:\n",
        "    - `max_profit` remains 4: `max(4, 3 - 1) = 4`\n",
        "    - `min_price` remains 1.\n",
        "  - `price = 6`:\n",
        "    - Update `max_profit`: `max(4, 6 - 1) = 5`\n",
        "    - `min_price` remains 1.\n",
